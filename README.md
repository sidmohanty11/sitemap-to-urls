**Sitemap to URLs** is a streamlined, user-friendly web application hosted at [sitemap-to-urls.vercel.app](https://sitemap-to-urls.vercel.app). This tool is designed to simplify the process of extracting and formatting URL lists from sitemap files.

## Backstory

Whenever I needed to scrape or gather a list of URLs for testing purposes (or perhaps URL pathnames), I found myself repeatedly writing a Node.js script to parse and process the data, or alternatively, performing these tasks in the browser console, which was quite cumbersome. Just wanted to build a tool to help me out in the future if I need to do it again.

## Features

- One click get everything
- Regex support - filter based on regex
- Get pathnames only
- JSON or Text any format you like
